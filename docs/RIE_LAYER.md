# RIE Layer

Research Infrastructure Engine (RIE) is a STEM retrieval + evidence instrument.

RIE performs:
- query capture (keywords, formula representations, image/diagram references)
- retrieval and ranking of educational sources
- provenance capture and trust signaling
- evidence bundle export (bibliography + pointers + manifest)

RIE does not perform:
- final-answer generation
- worked solutions
- writing assistance / rewriting
- replacing source reading/watching with synthetic explanations

RIE outputs are designed to be auditable: each result includes provenance fields and optional credential/trust signals.
