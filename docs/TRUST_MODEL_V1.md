# Trust Model v1

RIE uses tiered trust signals. Trust signals label provenance/credential evidence; they do not “ban” sources by default.

## Tiers
- Tier A: institutional / archival (universities, publishers, DOI registries, government science agencies)
- Tier B: verified individual experts (ORCID + institutional presence + cross-links)
- Tier C: community educators (allowed, clearly labeled)

## Signals
- domain verification (e.g., .edu, known publisher domains)
- DOI / Crossref metadata presence
- ORCID identity + publication linkage
- institutional directory or lab page linkage
- syllabus/course page linkage
